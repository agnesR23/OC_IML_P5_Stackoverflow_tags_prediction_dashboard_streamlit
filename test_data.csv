SSE2 - 16-byte aligned dynamic allocation of memory,"EDIT: 

This is a followup to SSE2 Compiler Error

This is the real bug I experienced before and have reproduced below by changing the _mm_malloc statement as Michael Burr suggested:


  Unhandled exception at 0x00415116 in SO.exe: 0xC0000005: Access violation reading 
  location 0xffffffff.


At line label: movdqa xmm0, xmmword ptr [t1+eax]

I'm trying to dynamically allocate t1 and t2 and according to this tutorial, I've used _mm_malloc:

#include &lt;emmintrin.h&gt;
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{ 
 int *t1, *t2;
 const int n = 100000;
 t1 = (int*)_mm_malloc(n*sizeof(int),16);
 t2 = (int*)_mm_malloc(n*sizeof(int),16);
 __m128i mul1, mul2;
  for (int j = 0; j &lt; n; j++)
  {
  t1[j] = j;
  t2[j] = (j+1);
  } // set temporary variables to random values

"LEFT JOIN or REGULAR JOIN, and how to compare MySql table to an array? Need performance!","I have six tables: t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6. And I also have one main table: main_table. TOTAL 7 TABLES!

Now, I am using SOLR for the searching of classifieds, and the results from solr are put into an array. The array results are ID:nrs which I use to match agains the same ID:s in MySql.

The first column of ALL tables in MySql is called classified_id.

If the user searches for ""cars"", then Solr will find all cars classifieds, put the id:s into an array and finally compare the MySql main table to match everything in table t1 (which is the cars table) where classified_id is the same in both tables.

The SOLR results array is first imploded, then:

SELECT * FROM classified, t1 WHERE classified.ad_id IN ('$solr_id_arr_imploded') AND classified.classified_id=t1.classified_id


My Q is, is this how I should do this? Is this how I should JOIN here, or use a LEFT JOIN? Is there any faster way of comparing to the array?

the table t1 may be empty if there are no car-classifieds...

Remember, the query could become very very long, for example if SOLR returns 10000 matches, then an array of 10000 id numbers which look like this would be returned: bmw_m3_low_miles_8948939

Thanks

UI for creating invoices,"Currently, I'm in the process of making a custom solution for invoicing. I have created multiple ways for customers to create their template (HTML, Word, LaTex) and get invoices according to their template. However, these invoices are party manually generated.

So, the process is:


Request to create a new invoice
An preliminary invoice is created
The user gets a chance to make changes (i.e. add, remove, change rows)
Create a pdf


Just to be clear, the preliminary invoice does not need to be formatted as the template is, but you should be able to add/remove/change rows and for every cell, indicate whether the value should be visible in the final result.

My problem is that i cannot find a suitable way to display the preliminary invoices. I tried a datagrid (default, telerik, devexpress), but it's too messy. Besides a datagrid, i have no idea what i can use. 

What controls can i use best to have a nice and usable UI.

Always double check Your multithreaded code in asp.net application. When  Unhandled exceptions occurs application pool crashes and it's damn hard to find WHY.

ComboBox.SelectedValue does not match displayed text when DropDownStyle = DropDownList in Windows 7,"Let's say we have the following code in a Windows application:

ComboBox comboBox = new ComboBox()
{
    AutoCompleteMode = AutoCompleteMode.SuggestAppend,
    AutoCompleteSource = AutoCompleteSource.ListItems,
    DataSource = new string[] { """", ""Ark"", ""Boat"", ""Bucket"" },
    DropDownStyle = ComboBoxStyle.DropDownList
};
this.Controls.Add(comboBox);

TextBox textBox = new TextBox()
{
    Left = comboBox.Right,
    Top = comboBox.Top,
    ReadOnly = true
};
textBox.DataBindings.Add(""Text"", comboBox, ""SelectedValue"");
this.Controls.Add(textBox);


No magic here, just a ComboBox bound to a list of strings.  The TextBox displays the SelectedValue of the ComboBox.

I'm getting unexpected behavior when I type ""Bucket"" into the ComboBox and tab away.  For some reason the ComboBox displays ""Boat"" but the TextBox displays ""Bucket"".  I would expect them both to display ""Bucket"".

It behaves as expected if I change the DropDownStyle to DropDown, but I don't want users to be able to type anything they want.  They should only be able to type items that are in the list.

Even more interesting is that, after typing ""Bucket"" and tabbing away, if I type ""Bucket"" again it will display ""Bucket"" in both.  If I make a third attempt, it goes back to ""Boat"" for the ComboBox and ""Bucket"" for the `TextBox'.  So it seems like it's cycling through all the B's.

I didn't notice this until I upgraded from XP to Windows 7 recently.  I don't see how that could have anything to do with this, but I'm throwing it out anyway.

If this behavior is correct, can anyone tell me what I should be doing to achieve my expected behavior?

UPDATE  It would seem this is related to Windows 7.  Everything behaves as expected in Windows XP Mode.  Can anyone else running Windows 7 try my code and verify that I'm not crazy?

What is the equivalent C# 3.0 Linq to SQL for this?,"Old VB6 Code that needs to be converted:

'DB Connection
Set Conn = New ADODB.Connection
Conn.ConnectionString = sConn
Conn.Open sConn
Conn.BeginTrans

'Recordset
Set rsPrice = New ADODB.Recordset
rsPrice.CursorLocation = adUseClient
rsPrice.CursorType = adOpenKeyset
rsPrice.LockType = adLockBatchOptimistic
rsPrice.ActiveConnection = Conn


What would be the exact equivalent of this in C# .NET 3.5 Linq to SQL?  I remember reading somewhere that using System.Transactions would require having MTS on the backend, but my memory is fuzzy this morning.

EDIT:

I could not find a direct match for CursorLocation, CursorType, and LockType up with the new APIs, which is the source of my confusion.  I am familiar with TransactionScope, but I do not know if the defaults of TransactionScope are acceptable or if I'm making a bone-headed mistake by trusting in them.  The database is SQL Server 2005.

Create a new image on the file system from System.Drawing.Image?,"Ok, I'm sorry, this is probably a noob question but I'm kinda stuck.

So what I'm doing (on my asp.net application) is loading an image from the file system:

System.Drawing.Image tempImage;

Then I do some resizing:

tempImage = my awesomeResizingFunction(tempImage, newSize);


and intend to save it to the file system in another location using this:

string newPath = ""/myAwesomePath/newImageName.jpg"";
tempImage.Save(newPath);


and what I get is this error:

""A generic error occurred in GDI+.""


I know the image is ""ok"" because I can write it out to the browser and see the resized image, I only get the error when I try to save it. I'm kinda new and stuck, am I doing this totally wrong? (Well, i guess that's obvious but you know what I mean...)

jquery ui datepicker inside asp.net UpdatePanel,"I have a web page, where I'm using a jQuery UI datepicker on an asp.net textbox, which is located inside an UpdatePanel. Here is a description of what I do roughly

&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;

&lt;/script&gt;

    &lt;asp:TextBox runat=""server"" CssClass=""datepicker"" /&gt;
    &lt;asp:Button runat=""server"" /&gt;

When I first load the page, everything works fine. When clicking inside the textbox, the datepicker pops up. But when I click the button, and an async postback is executed, the datepicker no longer pops up, when I click the field again.

I know that the problem is because the UpdatePanel completely replaces all the contained HTML when it is updated, so in effect, it is a new text field, which has not been initialized with the datepicker functionality.

I guess that I should not use $(document).ready() here to initialize my datepickers, but where is a good place to place the initialization code? Or is there a way that I can retrigger the initialization code after an AJAX update?

Relationship with Enumerated Type in Java,"I'm trying to create a many-to-many relationship between two types of which one is an Enumerated type. Lets say the first model is User and the second model is Role. A user can have many roles and a role can belong to many users.

"How to create a MAPI32.dll stub to be able to ""send as attachment"" from MS Word?","Microsoft Word has ""send as attachment"" functionality which creates a new message in Outlook with the document attached. 

I would like to replace Outlook with a custom mail agent, but I do not know how to achieve this. Now my mail agent is simply a program that runs, and takes a file name as parameter.

Further, I need to change the default mail agent by creating my own MAPI32.dll stub which simply redirects to my app.

What happens when a process is forked?,"I've read about fork and from what I understand, the process is cloned but which process? The script itself or the process that launched the script?

For example:

I'm running rTorrent on my machine and when a torrent completes, I have a script run against it. This script fetches data from the web so it takes a few seconds to complete. During this time, my rtorrent process is frozen. So I made the script fork using the following

my $pid = fork();
if ($pid == 0) { blah blah blah; exit 0; }


If I run this script from the CLI, it comes back to the shell within a second while it runs in the background, exactly as I intended. However, when I run it from rTorrent, it seems to be even slower than before. So what exactly was forked? Did the rtorrent process clone itself and my script ran in that, or did my script clone itself? I hope this makes sense.

How do I select a subset of items from an anonymous type IEnumerable?,"I have the following code.

MyDataContext db = MyDataContext.Create();
            bc =
                db.BenefitCodes.Select(
                    b =&gt;
                    new
                        {
                            BenCd = b.BenCd
                            , Description = b.BenDesc
                            , BenInterest = b.BenInterest
                            , CodeDescription = string.Format(""{0} - {1}"", b.BenCd, b.BenDesc)
                        });


I had to go the Anonymous type route as CodeDescription isn't a property of benefitCode and the customer wants it to appear this way in a dropDrownList. Anyways my question is how can I select a subset of items from this list? I need to select items based on the BenInterest attribute.

So this returns IEnumerable, so I am trying to go this route and this is where I get stuck. My intent is to build a new IEnumerable list and set a dropdown datasource to it.

 IEnumerator enumerator = BenefitCodes.GetEnumerator(); 
        while(enumerator.MoveNext())
        {
              //What can I do here to return items based on BenInterest? 
              //I basically either want items that have a BenInterest of 'E'
              // or items that DO NOT have a BenInterest of 'E'
              // this is based on the value of a radioButtonList on the page
        }


So how do I create a new Enumerable of the same Anonymous type that only contains the desired items.

Thanks for any help.

Mixing files and loops,"I'm writing a script that logs errors from another program and restarts the program where it left off when it encounters an error. For whatever reasons, the developers of this program didn't feel it necessary to put this functionality into their program by default.

Anyways, the program takes an input file, parses it, and creates an output file. The input file is in a specific format:

UI - 26474845
TI - the title (can be any number of lines)
AB - the abstract (can also be any number of lines)


When the program throws an error, it gives you the reference information you need to track the error - namely, the UI, which section (title or abstract), and the line number relative to the beginning of the title or abstract. I want to log the offending sentences from the input file with a function that takes the reference number and the file, finds the sentence, and logs it. The best way I could think of doing it involves moving forward through the file a specific number of times (namely, n times, where n is the line number relative to the beginning of the seciton). The way that seemed to make sense to do this is:

i = 1
while i &lt;= lineNumber:
    print original.readline()
    i += 1


I don't see how this would make me lose data, but Python thinks it would, and says ValueError: Mixing iteration and read methods would lose data. Does anyone know how to do this properly?

Creating T4 templates at runtime (build-time)?,"We are building an inhouse application which needs to generate HTML files for upload into eBay listings. We are looking to use a template engine to generate the HTML files based on database and static fields that we have pre-defined. The template also needs to have logic capabilities (if-then, foreach, etc).

We have looked at T4 and it looks perfect, but we don't see anything about whether it has the capabilities to be used at runtime, so that a user can create the T4 template, and then the application can ""compile"" it and generate the final HTML file. Is this possible, and how?

If not, are there other frameworks we should be looking at that has all these capabilities?

How to convert the current class name of asp.net usercontrols to string on c#?,"So I have tried GetType() but for some reason, It does include the namespace...
Does C# not have a property for a class specifying its name?
For example:

public class Parent : System.Web.UI.UserControl {
    public someFunction(){
        Child child = new Child();
        Console.WriteLine(child.ThePropertyThatContainsTheName);
    }
}

public class Child : Parent {
}


I have tried to create the Child with a string property that has the name hard-coded, but only if we could find a better workaround to this... maybe reflection or expressions...

Thanks in advance =)

String corruption and nonprintable characters using XML::Twig in Win32 Perl,"This is a really weird problem.  It's taken me practically all day to whittle it down to a small executable script that demonstrates the problem fully.  

Problem Summary: I'm using XML::Twig to pull a data snippet from an XML file, then I'm sticking that data snippet into the middle of another piece of data, let's call it parent data.  The parent data has this weird non-printable character at its beginning when I start.  It's vendor supplied data, so I cannot control it.  My problem is that after I stick the data snippet into the middle of the parent data, the final product has a new non-printable character at its beginning in addition to the one it started with originally.  This new non-printable character was not in either the parent data nor in the child data snippet.  I don't know where it's coming from nor how it's getting into my data.  

I'm doubtful that it is an XML::Twig bug because the string corruption occurs while reading a line from a filehandle in a while loop, but I've been unsuccessful at recreating my problem when I remove the XML::Twig code in my scripts so I had to leave it in.

This is my first experience with non-printable characters in strings that I'm trying to process.  Do I need to do something special instead of treating them like ordinary strings or something?  

I'm using ActiveState Perl 5.10.1 and XML::Twig 3.32 (latest) and the Eclipse 3.5.1 IDE on Windows XP.

one it started with originally . this new non printable character was not in either the parent data nor in the child data snippet . i do n't know where it 's coming from nor how it 's getting into my data . i 'm doubtful that it is an xml : :twig bug because the string corruption occurs while reading a line from a filehandle in a while loop , but i 've been unsuccessful at recreating my problem when i remove the xml : :twig code in my scripts so i had to leave it in . this is my first experience with non printable characters in strings that i 'm trying to process . do i need to do something special instead of treating them like ordinary strings or something ? i 'm using activestate perl 5.10.1 and xml : :twig 3.32 ( latest ) and the eclipse 3.5.1 ide on windows xp . here is a script that

".NET Hashtable - ""Same"" key, different hashes","Is it possible for two .net strings to have different hashes? I have a Hashtable with amongst others the key ""path"". When I loop through the elements in the table to print it, i can see that the key exists.

When trying to looking it up however, there is no matching element. Debugging suggests that the string I'm looking for has a different hash than the one I'm supplying as the key.

This code is in a Castle Monorail project, using brail as a view engine. The key I'm looking for is inserted by a brail line like this:

UrlHelper.Link(node.CurrentPage.LinkText, {@params: {@path: ""/Page1""}})


Then, in this method (in a custom IRoutingRule):

public string CreateUrl(System.Collections.IDictionary parameters)
{
    PrintDictionaryToLog(parameters);
    string url;
    if (parameters.Contains(""path"")) {
        url = (string)parameters[""path""];
    }
    else {
        return null;
    }
}


The key is printed to the log, but the function returns null. I didn't know this could even be a problem with .net strings, but I guess this is some kind of encoding issue?

Oh, and this is running mono.

As per request, here is the relevant line from the log:

"Evaluating expressions inside C++ strings: ""Hi ${user} from ${host}""","I'm looking for a clean C++ way to parse a string containing expressions wrapped in ${} and build a result string from the programmatically evaluated expressions.

Example:  ""Hi ${user} from ${host}"" will be evaluated to ""Hi foo from bar"" if I implement the program to let ""user"" evaluate to ""foo"", etc.

The current approach I'm thinking of consists of a state machine that eats one character at a time from the string and evaluates the expression after reaching '}'. Any hints or other suggestions?

Note: boost:: is most welcome! :-)

Update Thanks for the first three suggestions! Unfortunately I made the example too simple! I need to be able examine the contents within ${} so it's not a simple search and replace. Maybe it will say ${uppercase:foo} and then I have to use ""foo"" as a key in a hashmap and then convert it to uppercase, but I tried to avoid the inner details of ${} when writing the original question above... :-)

Just so you know, I don't have control over the Oracle DB Server Environment. 
I enabled Hibernate tracing/logging and found a VALID SQL. I even put Wireshark(which is a TCP packet filter) to see what hibernate actually sends and that was a valid SQL. So, why would Oracle complain about it once in a while and NOT always.

But could the user do this using any of the  built-in apps?  I suppose one could easily write an app that puts more than one item in the pasteboard (so for my app to be robust, it should handle that situation).

Update: I understand that programmatically one could put more than one item in the pasteboard (using addItems as Kevin Ballard points out, or by setting the items property to an array containing more than one dictionary).  But could the user do this using any of the  built-in apps?  I suppose one could easily write an app that puts more than one item in the pasteboard (so for my app to be robust, it should handle that situation).

Help with C#.NET generic collections performance and optimization,"I am trying to optimize a piece of .NET 2.0 C# code that looks like this:

Dictionary&lt;myType, string&gt; myDictionary = new Dictionary&lt;myType, string&gt;();
// some other stuff
// inside a loop check if key is there and if not add element
if(!myDictionary.ContainsKey(currentKey))
{
   myDictionary.Add(currentKey, """");
}


Looks like the Dictionary has been used by whoever wrote this piece of code even if not needed (only the key is being used to store a list of unique values) because faster than a List of myType objects for search. 
This seems obviously wrong as only the key of the dictionary but I am trying to understand what's the best way to fix it.

Questions:

1) I seem to understand I would get a good performance boost even just using .NET 3.5 HashSet. Is this correct? 

2) What would be the best way to optimize the code above in .NET 2.0 and why?

EDIT:
This is existing code I am trying to optimize, it's looping through dozens of thousands items and for each one of them is calling a ContainsKey. There's gotta be a better way of doing it (even in .NET 2.0)! :)
","Help with C#.NET generic collections performance and optimization I am trying to optimize a piece of .NET 2.0 C# code that looks like this:

Dictionary&lt;myType, string&gt; myDictionary = new Dictionary&lt;myType, string&gt;();
// some other stuff
// inside a loop check if key is there and if not add element
if(!myDictionary.ContainsKey(currentKey))
{
   myDictionary.Add(currentKey, """");
}


Looks like the Dictionary has been used by whoever wrote this piece of code even if not needed (only the key is being used to store a list of unique values) because faster than a List of myType objects for search. 
This seems obviously wrong as only the key of the dictionary but I am trying to understand what's the best way to fix it.

.NET 2.0 Web Services WSDL Fault element being ignored?,"I have a web service method where I would like to throw some custom exceptions e.g. SomeException, SomeOtherException etc which the web service would then turn into a SOAP fault which the client would be able to handle. In Java I can have wsdl:fault elements within the wsdl:operation element in the WSDL. It appears it .NET that this is not catered for and that there is no way of putting attributes on a WebMethod to show what SOAP faults may occur.

If I create a Java web service which has wsdl:fault elements and add a web reference to a .NET project I would have expected the wsdl:fault elements to cause appropriately named exceptions to be created just as the other entities are created, this however does not seem to be the case.

Is it the case that wsdl:fault elements in a WSDL are completly ignored by .NET? They are part of the WSDL specification defined at http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl so this wasn't the behaviour I was expecting.

If this is the case possible work arounds might be returning a result object which contains a success/failure boolean value and an error message/enum. Or by using SoapExceptions. If I choose to use SoapExceptions I am then putting the emphesis on the user of my web service to handle these and deserialize it properly. Both of these don't seem a great way of handling this and add extra problems and code to workaround this. 

Any advice?

"What's a good way to handle ""async"" commits?","I have a WCF service that uses ODP.NET to read data from an Oracle database. The service also writes to the database, but indirectly, as all updates and inserts are achieved through an older layer of business logic that I access via COM+, which I wrap in a TransactionScope. The older layer connects to Oracle via ODBC, not ODP.NET.

The problem I have is that because Oracle uses a two-phase-commit, and because the older business layer is using ODBC and not ODP.NET, the transaction sometimes returns on the TransactionScope.Commit() before the data is actually available for reads from the service layer. 

I see a similar post about a Java user having trouble like this as well on Stack Overflow.

A representative from Oracle posted that there isn't much I can do about this problem:


  This maybe due to the way OLETx
  ITransaction::Commit() method behaves.
  After phase 1 of the 2PC (i.e. the
  prepare phase) if all is successful,
  commit can return even if the resource
  managers haven't actually committed.
  After all the successful ""prepare"" is
  a guarantee that the resource managers
  cannot arbitrarily abort after this
  point. Thus even though a resource
  manager couldn't commit because it
  didn't receive a ""commit"" notification
  from the MSDTC (due to say a
  communication failure), the
  component's commit request returns
  successfully. If you select rows from
  the table(s) immediately you may
  sometimes see the actual commit occur
  in the database after you have already
  executed your select. Your select will
  not therefore see the new rows due to
  consistent read semantics. There is
  nothing we can do about this in Oracle
  as the ""commit success after
  successful phase 1"" optimization is
  part of the MSDTC's implementation.


So, my question is this:

How should I go about dealing with the possible delay (""asyc"" via the title) problem of figuring out when the second part of the 2PC actually occurs, so I can be sure that data I inserted (indirectly) is actually available to be selected after the Commit() call returns?

How do big systems deal with the fact that the data might not be ready for reading immediately?

How to render contents of a tag in unicode in BeautifulSoup?,"This is a soup from a WordPress post detail page:

content = soup.body.find('div', id=re.compile('post'))
title = content.h2.extract()
item['title'] = unicode(title.string)
item['content'] = u''.join(map(unicode, content.contents))


I want to omit the enclosing div tag when assigning item['content']. Is there any way to render all the child tags of a tag in unicode? Something like:

item['content'] = content.contents.__unicode__()


that will give me a single unicode string instead of a list.

"How can you tell if a language is a ""dynamic language""?","I'm trying to get a better handle on what it really means for a language to be ""dynamic"". I have quite a bit of experience with Lingo, which is the scripting language for the Adobe (formerly Macromedia) Director product line, and I'm just wondering if it would be considered a ""dynamic language"".

The way variables and lists are handled seems very ""dynamic language""-ish to me.

With variables, you would just write foo = 3 or bar = ""Hello World"". You don't declare a variable as an int or string--it figures that out as is goes.

With lists, you can just write something like miscCollection = [3, ""Hello World"", #helloWorld, [""Embedded List"", ""Goes Here"", 3], [#phrase: ""Property List goes here"", #value: 3]]. Would this not be similar to a tuple?

Are these features enough to qualify for ""dynamic language"" status?

Interestingly, I've been using C# a lot more and Director/Lingo a lot less, but with all the excitement over dynamic languages these days, I wonder if I'm actually going against the grain.

EDIT

Regarding Mark Rushakoff answer, below, here's an attempt to analyze whether Lingo qualifies as ""dynamic"" using this Wikipedia article:


Eval - Lingo has do and value keywords. do will execute an entire command, e.g., do ""foo = 23"" or do ""foo = sum(20, 3)"". value attempts to convert a string into a numeric, but it is more than just a parsing operator--it can actually convert a string representation of a variable into its number, e.g., assuming foo = 23, the statement value(""foo"") will evaluate to 23.
Higher-Order Functions - If I'm understanding this right, this is basically what I would be called a ""delegate"" in C#. Lingo doesn't support this directly as far as I know, although you could create a type (called a ""parent script"") that has a function and pass an instance of the type.
Closures - No support for this as far as I know.
Continuation - No support for this as far as I know.
Reflection - In a sense at least, yes. You actually create new instances of types using a string, e.g., fooInstance = script(""Foo"").new(bar). It is also possible to convert an instance of a type into a string that contains the name of the type (so you can sort of mimic c#'s GetType() functionality). You can also query the properties of a type without knowing the names of the properties (e.g., look up a property by index) and find out the names of the properties by index.
Macros - The way the Wikipedia article describes a macro, I don't believe so. It is possible to edit scripts at runtime, however, so maybe that counts.


So, it seems that Lingo scores a 2 to 3 out of 6 on dynamic features, but I'm not clear enough on closures and continuations to know for sure that Lingo doesn't support them. I guess I'm not sure what to conclude. Comments welcome.

Framework for running distributed computations in .NET cloud,"I'm thinking about developing a framework to simplify running distributed computations in .NET cloud environment of Windows Azure. 

Azure currently (and by the time of the release, most likely) is completely unsuited for simple running of distributed queries in the cloud (details). Simple for me is something like DryadLINQ where you can write a query:

var results = from c in collection
  where IsLegal(c.Key)
  select new 
  { 
    Key = Hash(c.Key), 
    Result = RunModel(c.Value); 
  };


and have it executed remotely over multiple machines in the cluster. No deployments, storages or configurations to bother with.

What resources, papers or open source projects could you advise to check for additional information on the subject (esp. scheduling and DAG optimization)?

I've been digging around Hadoop (used by Amazon Elastic Map Reduce) &amp; DryadLINQ so far. Obviously this includes Googling.

Problem using pthread to utilize multiple cores,"I’m developing a Ray Tracer in C++ using SDL and Pthread. I’m having issues making my program utilize two cores. The threads work, but they don’t use both cores to 100%. To interface SDL I write directly to it's memory, SDL_Surface.pixels, so I assume that it can't be SDL locking me.

My thread function looks like this:

void* renderLines(void* pArg){
while(true){
    //Synchronize
    pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;frame_mutex);
    pthread_cond_wait(&amp;frame_cond, &amp;frame_mutex);
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;frame_mutex);

    renderLinesArgs* arg = (renderLinesArgs*)pArg;
    for(int y = arg-&gt;y1; y &lt; arg-&gt;y2; y++){
        for(int x = 0; x &lt; arg-&gt;width; x++){
            Color C = arg-&gt;scene-&gt;renderPixel(x, y);
            putPixel(arg-&gt;screen, x, y, C);
        }
    }

    sem_post(&amp;frame_rendered);
    }
}


Note: scene->renderPixel is const, so I assume both threads can read from the same memory.
I have two worker threads doing this, in my main loop I make these work using:

//Signal a new frame
pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;frame_mutex);
pthread_cond_broadcast(&amp;frame_cond);
pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;frame_mutex);

//Wait for workers to be done
sem_wait(&amp;frame_rendered);
sem_wait(&amp;frame_rendered);

//Unlock SDL surface and flip it...


Note: I've also tried creating and joining the threads instead of synchronizing them.
I compile this with ""-lpthread -D_POSIX_PTHREAD_SEMANTICS -pthread"" and gcc does not complain.

My problem is best illustrated using a graph of the CPU usage during execution:

(source: jopsen.dk)  

As can be seen from the graph my program only uses one core at a time, then switching between the two every once in a while, but it doesn't drive both to 100% ever.
What in the world have I done wrong? I'm not using any mutex or semaphors in scene.
What can I do to find the bug?

Also if I put while(true) around scene->renderPixel() I can push both cores to 100%. So I've suspected that this is caused by overhead, but I only synchronize every 0.5 second (e.g. FPS: 0.5), given a complex scene.
I realize it might not be easy to tell me what my bug is, but an approach to debugging this would be great too... I haven't played with pthreads before...

Also, can this be a hardware or kernel issue, my kernel is:

Custom ViewModel Class - Not all fields are marked invalid unless a prefix is specified,"I have a custom viewmodel inside which I have two fields and one linq2sql entity .. all fields have Validation Attributes attached. Even if all fields are invalid only the fields in the linq2sql class are visually indicated for error and fields in the viewmodel are displayed normally. But the error messages are displayed for all invalid fields.

My Custom ViewModel looks like this:

public class BooksViewModel
{
    public SelectList BookCategories { get; set; }

    public Book Book { get; set; }

    [Required(ErrorMessage=""Field1 is required"")]
    [StringLength(10)]
    public string Field1 { get; set; }

    [Required(ErrorMessage = ""Field2 question is required"")]
    [StringLength(100)]
    public string Field2 { get; set; }
}


The Book class is a linq2sql entity which has a metadatatype attribute attached for validation.

[MetadataType(typeof(BookMetadata))]
public partial class Book
{
}
public class BookMetadata
{
    [Required(ErrorMessage=""Choose a category"")]
    public int CategoryID { get; set; }

    [Required(ErrorMessage = ""Title is required"")]
    [StringLength(100)]
    public string Title { get; set; }

    [Required(ErrorMessage = ""Published date is required"")]
    [DataType(DataType.Date, ErrorMessage=""Enter a valid date"")]
    public DateTime PublishedDate { get; set; }

    [Required(ErrorMessage = ""Author is required"")]
    [StringLength(50)]
    public string Author { get; set; }
}


There is a AddBook method in the repository with two overloads. One takes the viewmodel and one takes a Book type:

public void AddBook(Book book)
{
    var errors = DataAnnotationsValidationRunner.GetErrors(book);

    if (errors.Any()) {
        throw new RulesException(errors);
    }

    _db.Books.InsertOnSubmit(book);
    _db.SubmitChanges();
}

public void AddBook(BooksViewModel model)
{
    var errors = DataAnnotationsValidationRunner.GetErrors(model);

    if (errors.Any()) {
        throw new RulesException(errors);
    }
}


The Create action in the controller looks like this:

[AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)]
public ActionResult Create([Bind(Exclude = ""Book.ID"")]BooksViewModel booksViewModel)
{
    try {
        // Validate Book
        _repository.AddBook(booksViewModel.Book);
    } catch(RulesException ex) {
        ex.AddModelStateErrors(ModelState, ""Book"");
    }

    try {
        // Validate other fields in the view model
        _repository.AddBook(booksViewModel);
    } catch (RulesException ex) {
        ex.AddModelStateErrors(ModelState, """");
    }

    if (ModelState.IsValid) {
        return RedirectToAction(""Index"");
    } else {
        booksViewModel.BookCategories = new SelectList(_repository.GetAllCategories().AsEnumerable(), ""ID"", ""CategoryName"", booksViewModel.Book.CategoryID);
        return (ActionResult)View(booksViewModel);
    }
}


I am using xVal to generate client side validation rules .. My create view looks like this:

&lt;% using (Html.BeginForm()) {%&gt;

    &lt;fieldset&gt;
        &lt;legend&gt;Fields&lt;/legend&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;

            &lt;%= Html.ValidationMessage(""Book.CategoryID"", ""*"")%&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;%= Html.ClientSideValidation&lt;BooksViewModel&gt;() %&gt;
&lt;%= Html.ClientSideValidation&lt;Book&gt;(""Book"") %&gt;


the client side validation work fine .. but if I turn off javascript and then post back the form error message are displayed for all fields but the Field1 &amp; Field2 are not marked as invalid .. there is no css class added to the fields and no span tags are generated for visual error indication.

Screenshot http://img22.imageshack.us/img22/324/26677634.jpg

But if I pefix the ViewModel fields with anything 

public ActionResult Create([Bind(Prefix = ""VM"", Exclude = ""Book.ID"")]BooksViewModel booksViewModel)


And modify the view accordingly then everything works fine:

&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;label for=""VM.Book.Title""&gt;Title:&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;%= Html.TextBox(""VM.Book.Title"")%&gt;
    &lt;%= Html.ValidationMessage(""VM.Book.Title"", ""*"")%&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;label for=""VM.Field1""&gt;Field1:&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;%= Html.TextBox(""VM.Field1"")%&gt;
    &lt;%= Html.ValidationMessage(""VM.Field1"", ""*"")%&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;%= Html.ClientSideValidation&lt;BooksViewModel&gt;(""VM"") %&gt;
&lt;%= Html.ClientSideValidation&lt;Book&gt;(""Book"") %&gt;

"How do I remedy ""The breakpoint will not currently be hit. No symbols have been loaded for this document."" warning?","A C# desktop application (on the Visual Studio Express edition) worked, but then it didn't work 5 seconds later.
I tried the following:

Ensure debug configuration, debug flag, and full debug information are set on all assemblies.
Delete all bin and obj folders and all DLL files related to the project from my entire machine.
Recreate projects causing the problem from scratch.
Reboot.

I have two Windows Forms projects in the solution. One of them loads the debug information, one doesn't. They both refer to the assembly I'm trying to get debug information on in exactly the same way in the project file. Any ideas?

I want to add here, mostly for myself when I come back to review this question, that symbols are not loaded until the assembly is loaded, and the assembly is not loaded until it is needed. If the breakpoint is in a library that is only used in one function in your main assembly, the symbols will not be loaded (and it will show the breakpoint as not being hit) until that function is called.

Growing an Iframe depending on the source inside it (which is another Server),"I use javascript to expand an Iframe to the size of the document it loads to remove any vertical scrollbar, like so:

function resizeIframes() {
    $('iframe').load(function()
        {
            this.style.height = (this.contentWindow.document.body.offsetHeight + 40) + 'px';

    );
}


Which works well enough for my uses. But now I need to load the Iframe with a website from another server (actually another subdomain, instead of ""www.mydomain.com"" it's ""services.mydomain.com"") and according to Firebug I'm not allowed to read properties from other domains via Javascript. I'm guessing some kind of sandbox problem?!

Is there any way to circumvent this or at least get some kind of info about the size of the content? I even would be willing to check if there is a scrollbar and continually grow the iframe until it's gone, but unlike the window object an iframe object does not seem to have a .scrollbars property.

Disabling Accessibility Shortcuts in .NET Application?,"This msdn article -- http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb219746(VS.85).aspx#Disabling_Accessibility_Shortcut_Keys -- provides information for C++ programmers on how to temporarily disable the windows shortcuts for accessibility (such as holding Shift for 8 seconds, or pressing Shift more than 5 times in quick succession).

Surely there's some easy way to do this in C#, but I can't find any resources on this.  I'm using DirectInput in a non-fullscreen application.  

All I want to do is not have the annoying popups come up; I'd prefer something that doesn't have to muck with the windows settings, though, just in case the application shuts down in a non-graceful manner (I'd prefer not to have the user's settings be permanently altered in those situations).

Any thoughts?

Simulating an Active Directory Login in Dev/Test Environment,"Currently building a WPF app that will run in an environment where the user logs into Windows PC which is on a domain (DC).  The app will ask the user to enter their login and password again when it starts up, and the login/password will be verified against Active Directory (forgive me if my terminology is not correct here).

The login is all-or-nothing; if their password is correct, there is no (current) concern with retrieving groups, rights or anything of that nature.

The development environment is not AD-based, and is not on a domain.  Are there any options for simulating this kind of login without going through the process of setting up a domain controller and adding the development and test environment machines to it?

There will be some opportunity to do deployment testing during the course of the project (IOW create a test login app, deploy it to the user and make sure the login works before final deployment).  At the same time, I will need to use some sort implementation that works in the test/dev environment.

Any thoughts?  Would you recommend against simulating this in lieu of setting up a DC?

how to extract all text from HTML file using PHP?,"how to extract all text from HTML file

I want to extract all text, in the alt attributes, &lt; p > tags, etc..

    function clean($in){

This works great but it retrieves script and style tags which I don't want to retrieve 
and the other problem I am not sure if it does retrieve attributes like alt - since strip_tags function might remove all HTML tags with their attributes

Thanks

    &lt;?PHP
    $string =  trim(clean(strtolower(strip_tags($html_content))));
    $arr = explode("" "", $string);
    $count = array_count_values($arr);
    foreach($count as $value =&gt; $freq) {
          echo trim ($value).""---"".$freq.""&lt;br&gt;"";
    }

    function clean($in){
           return preg_replace(""/[^a-z]+/i"", "" "", $in);
    }

    ?&gt;


This works great but it retrieves script and style tags which I don't want to retrieve 
and the other problem I am not sure if it does retrieve attributes like alt - since strip_tags function might remove all HTML tags with their attributes

Thanks

Specifying a VC++ Redistributable version for ClickOnce prerequisite,"My ClickOnce application uses a third party tool that requires the Visual C++ 2005 redistributable. The third party tool will not work if only the VC++ 2008 redistributable is installed. However, in Visual Studio 2008, the ClickOnce prerequisites do not allow a version to be specified for the VC++ redistributable; it will add a VC++ 2008 prerequisite, which makes sense most of the time. However, in this situation, an earlier version is required. ClickOnce is required, so merge modules are out of the question. Any ideas of how to specify the version?

How to get rid of keyboard when user taps background (iPhone),"

  Dismiss keyboard by touching background of UITableView  




I have a custom UIScrollView which contains UITableView and UITextView. When user clicks on text field, keyboard pops up and it also disappears when user presses Return key on keyboard.

Question: How to get rid of keyboard when user taps on UITableView? No matter what I try, I just can't catch any touch events... Using iPhone 3.0 SDK since that does seem to make a big difference. As far as I understand touch events are not automatically redirected to... anywhere! Still there are touch events, since I can scroll table view up/down, even I don't want to!

What do I have to do to dismiss keyboard, when user presses somewhere else but keyboard itself or the text field?

CALayer and CGGradientRef anti-aliasing?,"I'm having an odd issue with CALayer drawing for the iPhone.  I have a root layer which adds a bunch of sublayers representing ""bubbles"".  The end result is supposed to look something like this:

http://www.expensivedna.com/IMG_0018.PNG http://www.expensivedna.com/IMG_0018.PNG

The problem is that I can't seem to get the layer to anti-alias (notice the jaggies on the bubbles).  My code overwriting drawInContext for the bubble CALayer is as follows:

- (void)drawInContext:(CGContextRef)theContext{
CGContextSetAllowsAntialiasing(theContext, true);
CGContextSetShouldAntialias(theContext, true);

size_t num_locations = 2;
CGFloat locations[2] = { 0.0, 1.0 };
CGFloat components[8] = { 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5,  // Start color
                          1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0 }; // End color
CGColorSpaceRef rgbColorspace = CGColorSpaceCreateDeviceRGB();
CGGradientRef glossGradient = 
CGGradientCreateWithColorComponents(rgbColorspace, components, locations, num_locations);

CGPoint topCenter = CGPointMake(25, 20);
CGPoint midCenter = CGPointMake(25, 25);
CGContextDrawRadialGradient(theContext, glossGradient, midCenter, 20, topCenter, 10, kCGGradientDrawsAfterEndLocation); 


}

Now the really odd thing is that if I slightly alter the drawing code to only draw normal red circles as follows:

- (void)drawInContext:(CGContextRef)theContext{
CGContextSetAllowsAntialiasing(theContext, true);
CGContextSetShouldAntialias(theContext, true);

CGContextSetFillColorWithColor(theContext, [UIColor redColor].CGColor);

Flex 3 Regular Expression Problem,"I've written a url validator for a project I am working on. For my requirements it works great, except when the last part for the url goes longer than 22 characters it breaks. My expression:

It expects input that looks like ""http(s)://hostname:port/location"". 
When I give it the input:

it works, but if I pass the input

it breaks. You can test it out easily at http://ryanswanson.com/regexp/#start. Oddly, I can't reproduce the problem with just the relevant (I would think) part /(:\d+\/\S+)/i. I can have as many characters after the required / and it works great. Any ideas or known bugs?

Why is System/mscorlib code so much faster? Especially for loops?,"This is just a personal project I've been digging into. Basically, I parse a text file (say from 20mb up to about 1gb) using StreamReader. The performance is pretty solid, but still... I've been itching to see what would happen if I parse it in binary. Don't misunderstand, I'm not prematurely optimizing. I am defintely micro-optimizing on purpose just ""to see"".

So, I'm reading in the text file using byte arrays. Come to find out, new lines can be the (Windows) standard CR/LF or CR or LF... pretty messy. I had hoped to be able to use Array.IndexOf on CR and then skip past the LF. Instead I find myself writing code very similar to IndexOf but checking for either and returning an array as needed.

So the crux: using very similar code to IndexOf, my code still ends up being insanely slower. To put it in perspective using an 800mb file:


Using IndexOf and looking for CR: ~320mb/s
Using StreamReader and ReadLine: ~180mb/s
for loop replicating IndexOf: ~150mb/s


here's the code with the for loop (~150mb/s):

IEnumerator&lt;byte[]&gt; IEnumerable&lt;byte[]&gt;.GetEnumerator() {
    using(FileStream fs = new FileStream(_path, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.ReadWrite, _bufferSize)) {
        byte[] buffer = new byte[_bufferSize];
        int bytesRead;
        int overflowCount = 0;
        while((bytesRead = fs.Read(buffer, overflowCount, buffer.Length - overflowCount)) &gt; 0) {
            int bufferLength = bytesRead + overflowCount;
            int lastPos = 0;
            for(int i = 0; i &lt; bufferLength; i++) {
                if(buffer[i] == 13 || buffer[i] == 10) {
                    int length = i - lastPos;
                    if(length &gt; 0) {
                        byte[] line = new byte[length];
                        Array.Copy(buffer, lastPos, line, 0, length);
                        yield return line;
                    }
                    lastPos = i + 1;
                }
            }
            if(lastPos &gt; 0) {
                overflowCount = bufferLength - lastPos;
                Array.Copy(buffer, lastPos, buffer, 0, overflowCount);
            }
        }
    }
}


this is the faster code block (~320mb/s):

while((bytesRead = fs.Read(buffer, overflowCount, buffer.Length - overflowCount)) &gt; 0) {
    int bufferLength = bytesRead + overflowCount;
    int pos = 0;
    int lastPos = 0;
    while(pos &lt; bufferLength &amp;&amp; (pos = Array.IndexOf&lt;byte&gt;(buffer, 13, pos)) != -1) {
        int length = pos - lastPos;
        if(length &gt; 0) {
            byte[] line = new byte[length];
            Array.Copy(buffer, lastPos, line, 0, length);
            yield return line;
        }
        if(pos &lt; bufferLength - 1 &amp;&amp; buffer[pos + 1] == 10)
            pos++;
        lastPos = ++pos;

    }
    if(lastPos &gt; 0) {
        overflowCount = bufferLength - lastPos;
        Array.Copy(buffer, lastPos, buffer, 0, overflowCount);
    }
}


(No, it ain't production ready, certain cases will make it blow up; I use a 128kb size buffer to ignore most of those.)

So my big question is... why does Array.IndexOf work so much faster? It is essentially the same, a for loop walking an array. Is there something about the way mscorlib code is executed? Even changing the above code to really replicate IndexOf and looking for just CR and then skipping LF like I would if using IndexOf doesn't help. Errr... I've been going through various permutations and it's late enough that perhaps there is some glaring bug I am missing?

BTW, I looked into ReadLine and noticed it uses a switch block rather than an if block... when I do something similar, weirdly enough it does increase the performance by about 15mb/s. That's another questions for another time (why is switch faster than if?) but I figured I'd point out that I did look at it.

Also, I am testing a release build outside of VS so there is no debuggery going on.

How can I run a query on a dataset that returns different columns to the table?,"I'm trying to pull some data from a SQL table in my dataset using C#.

In this case I do not need all the columns just a few specific ones, however as I am not pulling back a column with a mandatory NOT NULL, the copy of the table is throwing the exception   

""Failed to enable constraints. One or more rows contain values violating non-null, unique, or foreign-key constraints.""


I'm sure I can work around this by returning the unNullable column to my table however I want to avoid returning unnecessary data.

The query I am using which throws this exception is  

SELECT     DeviceSerialNumber, BuildID, LEMSCredentialsID, LEMSSoftwareID, OwnerID, RestagedDate
FROM         tblDevice
WHERE     (DeviceSerialNumber = @SerialNumber)


This excludes the mandatory column ""tblLocationID"". In reality though, this column is only mandatory when considering the database as a whole, not when I just need build and software detail for use in my form.

I am trying to use this query in the following manner.

private DataTable dtDevice;

dtDevice = taDevice.GetDataByDeviceSN_ForRestage(txtDeviceSerial.Text);


I notice when browsing the preview data, Visual Studio draws columns that are not specified in my SQL including the column tblLocationID it does not however populate these columns with data. 

Is there anyway I can use this data in a temporary table without importing the non-nullable aspect of the column? preferably by not pulling through the non-selected columns at all?
