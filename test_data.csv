PHP Sessions/cookies not storing correctly when using IE6/IE7,"We have a local intranet site that everyone on the network uses.  Maybe 5% (or even less) of the users that use the site have problems where the session isn't stored properly.

I've tried defining a path manually (C:/Coookieess) and checking to see what's going on.  Whereas most users' sessions are created and remain just fine, on the affected machines it seems that it either forgets the cookies are there or it can't read them, and then goes on to create a new cookie almost every time a page is refreshed.

Things to note are...


it only affects &lt;5% of users 
it only happens when using IE
it happens to those users regardless of what machine theyre using
it only happens with Windows XP or Vista - Windows 2000 works fine!


I've tried messing with the security settings in IE too, changing the cookie security to allow all cookies/sessions, but no luck on that either unfortunately :(

Any help would be amazing.  I'm really stuck on this.

Thanks!

Story of a mysterious bug Flex/ Actionscript,"Suddenly Flex seems to dislike variable declaration. For example I write (on the script part of a mxml component)

Animate UITableViewCell's imageView insertion?,"Hey guys, (relatively, I believe) simple question here,

I have a UITableViewController with its UITableView, with its determined number of cells. If a user taps on a cell, an image is inserted into the respective cell's imageView property, like so:

[self.tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:chosenPersonIndexPath].imageView.image = [UIImage imageNamed:@""tick.jpeg""];


(where chosenPersonIndexPath is simply the selected cell's index path)

Is there any way to animate this? As is, the UITableViewController simply sticks in the image with no transition whatsoever. All I'm asking is if there is a way to possibly animate this, and if so, how?

Many thanks in advance!

delaying the loading of a certain css background image,"in a CSS like this :

is there a way to delay the loading of #big-menu's background image, so that it loads after everything else, including all of the images in the HTML, and every other CSS background (the some-menu and some-other-menu).

The reason is, big-menu.jpg is very heavy in size, and I want it to be loaded last. After all, it just serves as an eye-candy, and there are other background images that have a better use than that. (such as the ones used in buttons)

Does the order of putting it in CSS or the occurrences of the markup (#big-menu) in HTML got anything to do with what gets loaded first ? or is there a more reliable way to control it ? javascript (jQuery preferred) is fine.

&lt;/toolkit:DataGridTemplateColumn&gt;&lt;/toolkit:DataGrid&gt;


Now, I have this problem. 

I have to update the dataValuesProvider with different value on each rows. Then I have insert a reset of dataValuesProvider (dataValuesProvider=null) on selectionchanged event of datagrid.

(The dataValuesProvider will load after a input on a specific cell of the selected row).

This is the problem: when I reset the dataValuesProvider (on selectionchanged of a new row) it's modified the SelectedValue of ComboBox and the Property1 of previous row is cleared.

I think that there is this behavior becouse the editing template of cell not update the binding associations until I edit the cell. It's right?

How can I do to avoid this problem?

Now, I have this problem. 

I have to update the dataValuesProvider with different value on each rows. Then I have insert a reset of dataValuesProvider (dataValuesProvider=null) on selectionchanged event of datagrid.

(The dataValuesProvider will load after a input on a specific cell of the selected row).

This is the problem: when I reset the dataValuesProvider (on selectionchanged of a new row) it's modified the SelectedValue of ComboBox and the Property1 of previous row is cleared.

I think that there is this behavior becouse the editing template of cell not update the binding associations until I edit the cell. It's right?

How can I do to avoid this problem?

Crawling engine architecture - Java/ Perl integration,"I am looking to develop a management and administration solution around our webcrawling perl scripts. Basically, right now our scripts are saved in SVN and are manually kicked off by SysAdmin/devs etc. Everytime we need to retrieve data from new sources we have to create a ticket with business instructions and goals. As you can imagine, not an optimal solution. 

There are 3 consistent themes with this system:


the retrieval of data has a ""conceptual structure"" for lack of a better phrase i.e. the retrieval of information follows a particular path
we are only looking for very specific information so we dont have to really worry about extensive crawling for awhile (think thousands-tens of thousands of pages vs millions)
crawls are url-based instead of site-based. 


As I enhance this alpha version to a more production-level beta I am looking to add automation and management of the retrieval of data. Additionally our other systems are Java (which I'm more proficient in) and I'd like to compartmentalize the perl aspects so we dont have to lean heavily on outside help. 

I've evaluated the usual suspects Nutch, Droid etc but the time spent on modifying those frameworks to suit our specific information retrieval cant be justified.  

So I'd like your thoughts regarding the following architecture. 

I want to create a solution which 


use Java as the interface for managing and execution of the perl scripts 
use Java for configuration and data access
stick with perl for retrieval


An example use case would be 


a data analyst delivers us a requirement for crawling
perl developer creates the required script and uses this webapp to submit the script (which gets saved to the filesystem) 
the script gets kicked off from the webapp with specific parameters 
....


Webapp should be able to create multiple threads of the perl script to initiate multiple crawlers. 

So questions are


what do you think
how solid is integration between Java and Perl specifically from calling perl from java 
has someone used such a system which actually is part perl repository


The goal really is to not have a whole bunch of unorganized perl scripts and put some management and organization on our information retrieval. Also, I know I can use perl do do the web part of what we want - but as I mentioned before - trying to keep perl focused. But it seems assbackwards I'm not adverse to making it an all perl solution. 

Open to any all suggestions and opinions.

SQL Server 2008: N small databases VS 1 database with N schemas,"I have a database server with few main databases, and few dozens of small ones.

These small databases are kind of intermediary/staging databases for data import from various sources into main database. Data import is a daily task. They are all quite similar in structure as the implementation of these data imports are similar, so basically they have a configuration tables, which define mapping, conversions etc, and the data tables, which contain the results of the import.

Some time ago there have been only the handful of small ones, but now I have more then 20 of them will grow further with the number of supported data feeds.

I have just migrated all the server environment to SQL Server 2008, and having some time now for clean-up/refactoring, I am thinking to merge all of data-import databases into just one database, and use database schema to separate them.

Question-0: Any other ideas for the described situation?

Question-1: Shall I change from a separate database to a separate schema?

Question-2: !!!: Any tricky thing to be careful about in database schema implementation?



Edit-1: highlighted question-2 as the most 'unanswered' currently.

They are all quite similar in structure as the implementation of these data imports are similar, so basically they have a configuration tables, which define mapping, conversions etc, and the data tables, which contain the results of the import.

Some time ago there have been only the handful of small ones, but now I have more then 20 of them will grow further with the number of supported data feeds.

I have just migrated all the server environment to SQL Server 2008, and having some time now for clean-up/refactoring, I am thinking to merge all of data-import databases into just one database, and use database schema to separate them.

Question-0: Any other ideas for the described situation?

Question-1: Shall I change from a separate database to a separate schema?

Question-2: !!!: Any tricky thing to be careful about in database schema implementation?



Edit-1: highlighted question-2 as the most 'unanswered' currently.

Java EE6 over EE5?,"We are at the edge of getting Java EE6 (with Glassfish v3 as reference implementation). Planned release is December 09. While still quite a number of companies are struggling to move their codebase to EE5 (from earlier versions), we are in the luxurious situation to start development of a new product and could choose to do it with EE6 as platform. That potentially avoids the migration effort at a later stage and benefit from all the rightsized features in EE6. 

Contra or few of the problems (when doing things at the bleeding edge, aka using EE6):


not much expertise around yet (blogs, books, forums, yourself,..)
there wont be any other EE6 application server soon (beta's maybe early/mid next year ?)
3rd party libraries/frameworks are maybe not verified or tested against EE6 yet.


A generic question that would not result in a specific answer, but maybe your take on the topic ?

Pass current transaction or use DependentClone?,"I have a WinForm application which uses SqlServer CE 3.5 as database. I use typed dataset queries for db operations.

Invalid Month in Date - Date format in Informix reverts sporadically,"So we have an AIX (ugh) server that runs an ERP system. This system's built in reports suck so I am of course tasked with building the reports we need.

I've got many reports I run and most of course are for specific dates, etc. The coding is done in C# running in ASP.net on a Windows 2003 Standard Server box. It uses the Informix CSDK to connect via the .Net Data Adapter that comes with the CSDK. The server runs Informix 10 on the AIX 5.2 server.

What's weird is that anytime we start and stop Informix or reboot the server, etc, it seems that Informix decides to change the way it's handled the date via the CSDK. If it's currently expecting MM/DD/YYYY then it'll eventually decide after the above situation that is wants it in YYYY/MM/DD. This usually ends up giving me an ""Invalid Month in Date"" error. Then I go into my dateformat function (made to easily allow me to fall back and forth) and manually change it over. A couple reports I built in the handling of this error and then retry the same query with the other format of the date. This of course is less than ideal and I'd like to get to the bottom of it!

Here is some pasted text from the ASP.net page error. Thanks!

","Invalid Month in Date - Date format in Informix reverts sporadically So we have an AIX (ugh) server that runs an ERP system. This system's built in reports suck so I am of course tasked with building the reports we need.

I've got many reports I run and most of course are for specific dates, etc. The coding is done in C# running in ASP.net on a Windows 2003 Standard Server box. It uses the Informix CSDK to connect via the .Net Data Adapter that comes with the CSDK. The server runs Informix 10 on the AIX 5.2 server.

What's weird is that anytime we start and stop Informix or reboot the server, etc, it seems that Informix decides to change the way it's handled the date via the CSDK. If it's currently expecting MM/DD/YYYY then it'll eventually decide after the above situation that is wants it in YYYY/MM/DD. This usually ends up giving me an ""Invalid Month in Date"" error. Then I go into my dateformat function (made to easily allow me to fall back and forth) and manually change it over. A couple reports I built in the handling of this error and then retry the same query with the other format of the date. This of course is less than ideal and I'd like to get to the bottom of it!

Here is some pasted text from the ASP.net page error. Thanks!

SQLite Performance Benchmark -- why is :memory: so slow...only 1.5X as fast as disk?,"Why is :memory: in sqlite so slow?

I've been trying to see if there are any performance improvements gained by using in-memory sqlite vs. disk based sqlite. Basically I'd like to trade startup time and memory to get extremely rapid queries which do not hit disk during the course of the application. 

However, the following benchmark gives me only a factor of 1.5X in improved speed. Here, I'm generating 1M rows of random data and loading it into both a disk and memory based version of the same table. I then run random queries on both dbs, returning sets of size approx 300k. I expected the memory based version to be considerably faster, but as mentioned I'm only getting 1.5X speedups. 

I experimented with several other sizes of dbs and query sets; the advantage of :memory: does seem to go up as the number of rows in the db increases. I'm not sure why the advantage is so small, though I had a few hypotheses: 


the table used isn't big enough (in rows) to make :memory: a huge winner
more joins/tables would make the :memory: advantage more apparent
there is some kind of caching going on at the connection or OS level such that the previous results are accessible somehow, corrupting the benchmark
there is some kind of hidden disk access going on that I'm not seeing (I haven't tried lsof yet, but I did turn off the PRAGMAs for journaling)


Am I doing something wrong here? Any thoughts on why :memory: isn't producing nearly instant lookups? Here's the benchmark:

Shouldn't RAM be almost instant relative to disk? What's going wrong here? 

Edit

Some good suggestions here. 

I guess the main takehome point for me is that **there's probably no way to make :memory: absolutely faster, but there is a way to make disk access relatively slower. ** 

In other words, the benchmark is adequately measuring the realistic performance of memory, but not the realistic performance of disk (e.g. because the cache_size pragma is too big or because I'm not doing writes). I'll mess around with those parameters and post my findings when I get a chance.  

That said, if there is anyone who thinks I can squeeze some more speed out of the in-memory db (other than by jacking up the cache_size and default_cache_size, which I will do), I'm all ears...

That said, if there is anyone who thinks I can squeeze some more speed out of the in-memory db (other than by jacking up the cache_size and default_cache_size, which I will do), I'm all ears...

Problems invoking methods on a COM thread from a WinForms GUI thread?,"I'm having trouble with my COM component written in .NET throwing warnings that look like:


  Context 0x15eec0 is disconnected.  No

  request on the COM component. This may
  cause corruption or data loss. To
  avoid this problem, please ensure that
  all contexts/apartments stay alive
  until the application is completely
  done with the RuntimeCallableWrappers
  that represent COM components that
  live inside them.


It looks like this is caused by my GUI thread calling functions in the COM thread without necessary syncronization.  For reference I'm using the guidelines set in http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229609%28VS.80%29.aspx for creating my GUI thread in the COM component.

My code looks something like:

class COMClass {
  // this is called before SomeMethod
  public void Init() {
    ComObject comObject = new ComObject(); // this is imported from a TLB

    // I create my GUI thread and start it as in the MSDN sample
    Thread newThread = new Thread(new ThreadStart(delegate() {
      Application.Run(new GUIForm(comObject));

Is there an established method for dealing with this? Calls to the GUI are no problem (Invoke/BeginInvoke) but calling the other way seems to be more difficult...

TCP Socket Server Builds Up CLOSE_WAITs Occasionally Over Time Until Inoperable,"Hopefully someone can help us as we're reaching as far as investigation can go!

We've got a simple asynchronous socket server written in C# that accepts connections from an ASP.NET web application, is sent a message, performs some processing (usually against a DB but other systems too) and then sends a response back to the client. The client is in charge of closing the connection.

We've been having issues where if the system is under heavy load over a long period of time (days usually), CLOSE_WAIT sockets build up on the server box (netstat -a) to an extent that the process will not accept any further connections. At that point we have to bounce the process and off it runs again.

We've tried running some load tests of our ASP.NET application to attempt to replicate the problem (because inferring some issue from the code wasn't possible). We think we've managed this and ended up with a WireShark packet trace of the issue manifesting itself as a SocketException in the socket server's logs:


  System.Net.Sockets.SocketException: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host
  at System.Net.Sockets.Socket.BeginSend(Byte[] buffer, Int32 offset, Int32 size, SocketFlags socketFlags, AsyncCallback callback, Object state)


I've tried to reproduce the issue from the packet trace as a single threaded process directly talking to the socket server (using the same code the ASP.NET app does) and am unable. 

Has anybody got any suggestions of next things to try, check for or obvious things we may be doing wrong?

Blowfish-encrypted messages between NSIS and PHP,"For a project I'm working on, I need to encrypt and decrypt a string using Blowfish in a compatible way across NSIS and PHP.

At the moment I'm using the Blowfish++ plugin for NSIS and the mcrypt library with PHP.  The problem is, I can't get them both to produce the same output.

Let's start with the NSIS Blowfish++ plugin.  Basically the API is:

; Second argument needs to be base64 encoded
; base64_encode(""12345678"") == ""MTIzNDU2Nzg=""

blowfish::encrypt ""test@test.com***"" ""MTIzNDU2Nzg=""
Pop $0 ; 0 on success, 1 on failure
Pop $1 ; encrypted message on success, error message on failure


There's no mention of whether it's CBC, ECB, CFB, etc. and I'm not familiar enough with Blowfish to be able to tell by  reading the mostly undocumented source.  I assume it's ECB since the PHP docs for mcrypt tells me that ECB doesn't need an IV.

I've also learned by reading the source code that the Blowfish++ plugin will Base64 decode the second argument to encrypt (I'm not sure why).  It also returns a Base64 encoded string.

For the PHP side of things, I'm basically using this code to encrypt:

$plainText = ""test@test.com***"";
$cipher = mcrypt_module_open(MCRYPT_BLOWFISH, '', MCRYPT_MODE_ECB, '');   
$iv = '00000000';  // Show not be used anyway.
$key = ""12345678"";

$cipherText = """";
if (mcrypt_generic_init($cipher, $key, $iv) != -1)
{
    $cipherText = mcrypt_generic($cipher, $plainText);
    mcrypt_generic_deinit($cipher);        
}

echo base64_encode($cipherText);


However, if I do all these things, I get the following output from each:

NSIS: GyCyBcUE0s5gqVDshVUB8w==
PHP:  BQdlPd19zEkX5KT9tnF8Ng==


What am I doing wrong?  Is the NSIS plugin not using ECB?  If not, what is it using for it's IV?

For the PHP side of things, I'm basically using this code to encrypt:

$plainText = ""test@test.com***"";
$cipher = mcrypt_module_open(MCRYPT_BLOWFISH, '', MCRYPT_MODE_ECB, '');   
$iv = '00000000';  // Show not be used anyway.
$key = ""12345678"";

$cipherText = """";
if (mcrypt_generic_init($cipher, $key, $iv) != -1)
{
    $cipherText = mcrypt_generic($cipher, $plainText);
    mcrypt_generic_deinit($cipher);        
}

echo base64_encode($cipherText);


However, if I do all these things, I get the following output from each:

NSIS: GyCyBcUE0s5gqVDshVUB8w==
PHP:  BQdlPd19zEkX5KT9tnF8Ng==


What am I doing wrong?  Is the NSIS plugin not using ECB?  If not, what is it using for it's IV?

Something like viewstate and session,"The problem that I am having is as follows:

I currently have a custom class that generates buttons and places them on a placeholder on a master page.

The events for these buttons put specific values into session that differs values for a database query. In essence, the buttons serve as filters for charts.

After creating all the buttons, I realized that session values will stay constant from page to page, so everytime a user enters a different page while another is open, the filters selected on the open page will remain constant for the new page that is opened.

At first, I wanted to use viewstate rather than session, but then realized that a master page and a content page do not share the same viewstate.

At the current time, I am thinking of using a prefix for the sesson key that will identify what page the filters actually exist for. However, I am not wanting to overload session with numerous values if the user wishes to have many pages open at the same time.

Any solutions that would entail a way to share viewstate (or some other way to store values) between app_code, the master, and the content page?

Eclipse: How to build an executable jar with external jar?,"I am trying to build an executable jar program which depends on external jar downloaded. In my project, I included them in the build path and can be run and debug within eclipse.

When I tried to export it to a jar, I can run the program but I can't when I try to press a button which includes function calls and classes from the external jar. I have edited the environment variables (Windows XP) CLASSPATH to include paths of all the external jar, but it doesn't work.

A point to note is that I got compile warnings while exporting my executable jar, but it doesn't show up any description about the warnings.

LinqToSql referenced entities will throw NullReferenceException,"I have a very interesting problem on my LinqToSql model. On some of my tables i have a references to other tables and in LinqToSql this is represented by a EnitiyRef class, when you are trying to access the references table LinqToSql will load the reference from the database.

On my development machine everything worked fine (the references were loaded perfectly) but last night i uploaded the changed to our production server and started getting NullReferenceExceptions when trying to access the reference on my tables.

var sale = db.Sales.Single(s =&gt; s.ID == 1);
string username = sale.User.Name;    // User is a reference to a User table

// On my server the sale.User throws an exception that its null (User) but the user
// is definitly in the database (there is even a FK constraint from Sale to User)

Detecting unusable pooled SqlConnections,"When I attempt to set an application role on a SqlConnection with sp_setapprole I sometimes get the following error in the Windows event log...


  The connection has been dropped because the principal that opened it subsequently assumed a new security context, and then tried to reset the connection under its impersonated security context. This scenario is not supported. See ""Impersonation Overview"" in Books Online.)


... and a matching exception is thrown in my application.

These are pooled connections, and there was a time when connection pooling was incompatible with app roles - in fact the old advice from Microsoft was to disable connection pooling (!!) but with the introduction of sp_unsetapprole it is now (in theory) possible to clean a connection before returning it to the pool.

I believe these errors occur when (for reasons unknown) sp_unsetapprole is not run on the connection before it is closed and returned to the connection pool.  sp_approle is then doomed to fail when this connection is returned from the pool.

I can catch and handle this exception but I would much prefer to detect the impending failure and avoid the exception (and messages in the event log) altogether.

Is it possible to detect the problem without causing the exception?

Thoughts or advice welcome.

Making a game in C++ using parallel processing,"I wanted to ""emulate"" a popular flash game, Chrontron, in C++ and needed some help getting started. (NOTE: Not for release, just practicing for myself)


Basics:
Player has a time machine. On each iteration of using the time machine, a parallel state
is created, co-existing with a previous state. One of the states must complete all the
objectives of the level before ending the stage. In addition, all the stages must be able
to end the stage normally, without causing a state paradox (wherein they should have
been able to finish the stage normally but, due to the interactions of another state,
were not).


So, that sort of explains how the game works. You should play it a bit to really 
understand what my problem is. 

I'm thinking a good way to solve this would be to use linked lists to store each state,
which will probably either be a hash map, based on time, or a linked list that iterates
based on time. I'm still unsure.

ACTUAL QUESTION:

Now that I have some rough specs, I need some help deciding on which data structures to use for this, and why. Also, I want to know what Graphics API/Layer I should use to do this: SDL, OpenGL, or DirectX (my current choice is SDL). And how would I go about implementing parallel states? With parallel threads?

EDIT (To clarify more):
OS -- Windows (since this is a hobby project, may do this in Linux later)
Graphics -- 2D
Language -- C++ (must be C++ -- this is practice for a course next semester)

Q-Unanswered: SDL : OpenGL : Direct X 
Q-Answered: Avoid Parallel Processing 
Q-Answered: Use STL to implement time-step actions.


So far from what people have said, I should:
1. Use STL to store actions.
2. Iterate through actions based on time-step.
3. Forget parallel processing -- period. (But I'd still like some pointers as to how it
could be used and in what cases it should be used, since this is for practice).


Appending to the question, I've mostly used C#, PHP, and Java before so I wouldn't describe myself as a hotshot programmer. What C++ specific knowledge would help make this project easier for me? (ie. Vectors?)

What classes of applications or problems do you prefer Python to strictly OO Languages?,"I've got a pretty strong background in C-style languages.  And have worked on several different types of projects.  I have just started taking a serious look at Python after reading Programming Collective Intelligence.  I understand that Python can solve any problem that C# can, and vice-versa.  But I am curious to know from those who use both regularly, when they choose one over the other.  Removing other factors, like coworkers experience, etc.  

When do you choose to create an application in Python instead of a static typed, purely OO language like C# or Java?

Edit:

I was afraid we were going to get off topic a bit with this question.  Python is an object oriented language.  But, as is stated below it may not be the preferred language when your application will have a very heavy business domain, etc.  I am aware that Python uses objects extensively, and that even functions are objects, something that is not true in all of the ""OO"" languages I brought up earlier.  

Despite my poor choice of words in the question (almost no languages fit nicely into two or three word descriptions, and it is really difficult to point out differences in languages without it appearing that you are talking down to a certain class of developer.), I am still very interested in what you have to say about when you prefer Python to other languages.

Pros and Cons of the available Visual Studio 2008 c++ project platforms?,"If choosing between:


ATL
Windows Forms
MFC
Win32


Specifically the application will be:


for completely in-house use.
Most users lack basic windows/pc knowledge. (consider simple UI)
used for automated testing which entails:-bringing in lots of data from external equipment (can choose VXI, USB, or Ethernet)-very heavy on graphics - likely directX
Lifespan of the application will be 10+ years (consider future windows platforms, etc.)
Users will be in very remote locations and offline while testing, but can be online each night to sync reports (separate application used for database syncing now) - consider program update challenges?
Program speed adds value - meaning the faster we can aquire and display data, the more testing can be done.  There is no bottleneck other than the program, simply every bit faster = every bit more productive. 


Again, c++ specifically - not C#.

","EJB Factory Class I'm trying to create an EJB factory class, which works like this: You have a method which takes as argument a class of an EJB, then it checks whether the EJB has a remote interface (if not throw an exception) and if it does, it returns the concerning EJB.

The code below does exactly this. However the object it returns is of the type of the remote interface of the concerning bean and not of the bean itself. How can I change this? Is there a way to tell Java that the generic type T is of the same type as the class passed to the methods.

        props.setProperty(""org.omg.CORBA.ORBInitialPort"", port);
        ctx = new InitialContext(props);
    }
.
    // To improve: The object returned should be of the type ejbClass
    // instead of the remote interface, which it implements
    public &lt;T&gt; T createEJB(Class ejbClass) throws NamingException
    {
        Class remoteInterface = null;
        for(Class interface_: ejbClass.getInterfaces()) {
            if(interface_.isAnnotationPresent(Remote.class))
                remoteInterface = interface_;
        }

        if(remoteInterface == null)
            throw new  IllegalArgumentException(

How to implement custom proxy server?,"Ultimately, I want to block downloads in .NET WebBrowser control, effectively restricting it to displaying HTML, images, scripts and the like, but never, ever display a ""Save as"" dialog to the user.

The solution proposed in an answer to that question was to hook up a custom proxy server that checks the responses and filters out anything that would lead to a download prompt. How can I implement such a proxy in my .NET application? I don't want to install third-party software or libraries.

I found the HttpListener class, but I've got two problems with it:


The listener requires a predefined set of prefixes that trigger it. I would, however, prefer not to hard-code host names or port numbers in my application, and keep it generic.
I would have to implement the code that does the actual request myself - isn't there something that does this for me where I can simply tap into the line, examining the contents of the response and changing them as neccessary (like a request filter in J2EE does on the server side)?


Update

Okay, I guess I need to make this clearer: My .NET (rich client) application is being used in multiple projects which also have web-based applications. The .NET application includes a reusable, generic form with a WebBrowser control. Other developers use that form to integrate access to their web applications into the .NET application.

I want to block downloads, so I want to have my WebBrowser form intercept all traffic and ensure that it does not lead to a ""Save as"" dialog. Thus...


I do not know what the host names will be
The WebBrowser points to the real URLs, the user clicks regular links, triggers JavaScript... all as served by the web application
If the WebBrowser pointed to localhost (as proposed), I'd have to parse responses and rewrite all links so they point at localhost again, preserving the original URL. I don't want to go through that hassle.

Upgrading DTS packages to SSIS Packages,"My question is similar to Upgrading SQL Server 2000 to 2005 or 2008 - DTS to SSIS but I have a few restrictions that I'd like the community to consider. 

We have two databases that currently run on SQL Server 2000 and we are being pushed to move off of this in favor of SQL server 2005 (We do not have 2008, it isn't an option). 

We have approximately 150 DTS packages that will need to be converted. According to the stack overflow post above, we shouldn't use the conversion tool available. We also anticipate that any ""backward compatibility"" patches that Microsoft may have released for SQL Server 2005 won't be installed on our server. 

Can anyone help me understand the learning curve involved in going from DTS to SSIS? For 150 packages, we've come up with a 900 hour estimate. Myself and a more senior developer will be working on this but we've never worked with SSIS. The 900 hours will be divided between us. As with any project, quality is the utmost importance. Is this estimate outrageous or low? 

We will have access to other developers who have worked with SSIS, so we won't be completely alone in this. Also, I've learned that DTS package conversion is not an option; it is not supported by our DBA staff. 

Some things we do with DTS include the following. This is by no means an exhaustive list:


Load XML, XLS, MDB, CSV, etc files in to SQL Server
Export XML, XLS, MDB, CSV, etc files  from SQL Server

"How to keep a ""things done"" count in a recursive algorithm in Java?","I have a recursive algorithm which steps through a string, character by character, and parses it to create a tree-like structure.  I want to be able to keep track of the character index the parser is currently at (for error messages as much as anything else) but am not keen on implementing something like a tuple to handle multiple returned types.

I tried using an Integer type, declared outside the method and passed into the recursive method, but because it's final, recursive call increments are ""forgotten"" when I return. (Because the increment of the Integer value makes the passed-by-value object reference point at a new object)

Is there a way to get something similar to work which won't pollute my code?

What is wrong with the JavaScript event handling in this example? (Using click() and hover() jQuery methods),"I'm working on a sort of proof-of-concept for a project that approximates Firebug's inspector tool. For more details, please see this related question.
Here is the example page. I've only tested it in Firefox:
http://troy.onespot.com/static/highlight.html
The idea is that, when you're mousing over any element that can contain text, it should &quot;highlight&quot; with a light gray background to indicate the boundaries of that element. When you then click on the element, it should alert() a CSS selector that matches it.
This is somewhat working in the example linked above. However, there's one fundamental problem. When mousing over from the top of the page to the bottom, it will pick up the paragraphs, &lt;h1&gt; element, etc. But, it doesn't get the &lt;div&gt;s that encompass those paragraphs. However, for example, if you &quot;sneak up&quot; on the &lt;div&gt; that contains the two paragraphs &quot;The area was settled...&quot; and &quot;Austin was selected...&quot; from the left - tracing down the left edge of the page and entering the &lt;div&gt; just between the two paragraphs (see this screenshot) - then it is picked up. I assume this has something to do with the fact that I haven't attached an event handler to the &lt;body&gt; element (where you're entering the &lt;div&gt; from if you enter from the left), but I have attached handlers to the &lt;p&gt;s (where you're entering from if you come from the top or bottom).
There are also other issues with mousing in and out elements - background colors that &quot;stick&quot; and the like - that I think are also related.
As indicated in the related question posted above, I suspect there is something about event bubbling that I don't understand that is causing unexpected behavior.
Can anyone spot what's wrong with my code?

iPhone Memory Management: No Need to Clean Up and Release Retained Objects on App Quit?,"Is the following true?


  When the app is about to quit, it's
  not necessary to clean up the memory
  by calling release on all your
  retained objects, because the iPhone
  OS will reclaim the memory it
  allocated for your app when you
  launched it. This is faster and safer
  than rely on the apps to correctly
  clean up after themselves. You can
  verify this by putting an NSLog call
  (or a debugger breakpoint) in the
  dealloc method of your application
  delegate and seeing it's never called.
  
  So, cleaning things up when the app is
  about to quit is useless. Moreover,
  you have very limited time before the
  OS wipes your app out, so don't waste
  it on cleaning things. Focus on saving
  your game and any other relevant
  stuff.

How to catch file creation and the responsible caller,"We are using a third part library to render 3d. In this library there is a ""memory tracker"" functionality that keeps track of all memory the library has allocated and freed during execution. This is a nice feature, since it helps by determining e.g. memory leaks.

By calling a certain function in this library a log file is generated in the current working directory of the process. Lately I've noticed that this file shows up in several different places, so my first thought was of course to always set the current working directory to the folder I want the log to show up in, and this works fine.

However, it turns out that this file is still created in various places without above mentioned function ever being called by the program. Hence, the file must somehow be created by the library without my consent. The creator of this library says that the engine never calls this method internally.

So, in order to prove him wrong (alternatively proving myself to be stupid (won't be the first time though)), I need a way to catch exactly when this file is created. FindFirstChangeNotification() will not do, since this will only provide me with information that something happened in some folder. Ideally I'd like to (either in process or out of process) intercept when this happens and somehow inject a process exception (e.g. make WinDbg catch this), so I through the callstack get the information I want.

Any suggestions are welcome.

Cheers!

"Has_Many, Belongs_To Relationship in a Database Driven Application","I am working on an an application that allows a user to search for a particular book on Amazon using a given search criterion (e.g. title, keyword, author.) I am currently attempting to store these search results to a MySQL database, but am struggling with the concept of relationships.

It seems natural that I would structure the models something like this:

class Search &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :books
end

class Book &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :search
end


If a user makes a second search, however, I need a way to update the search results with the new books. My first inclination is to do something like the following:

Search.update(1,:books)


Does the update method work like this? Am I on the right track?

Also, I feel unsure as to whether updating search results in a database is even the right route to take. Could there potentially be negative effects if two users search at the same time? My only reasoning behind storing those search results to a database is that I need to display the information for the book they chose later in the user session. I would imagine that if I only updated the search results and there were multiple users using the tool that would overturn the entire purpose of using the database, as the second user's search results would overwrite the first user's search results. Is this true?

Could I, perhaps, store the information in the user's cookie?

What's the most efficient method of continually deleting files older than X hours on Windows?,"I have a directory that continually fills up with ""artefact"" files. Many different programs dump their temporary files in this directory and it's unlikely that these programs will become self-cleaning any time soon.

Meanwhile, I would like to write a program that continually deletes files in this directory as they become stale, which I'll define as ""older than 30 minutes"".

A typical approach would be to have a timed mechanism that lists the files in the directory, filters on the old stuff, and deletes the old stuff. However, this approach is not very performant in my case because this directory could conceivably contain 10s or hundreds of thousands of files that do not yet qualify as stale. Consequently, this approach would continually be looping over the same thousands of files to find the old ones.

What I'd really like to do is implement some kind of directory listener that was notified of any new files added to the directory. This listener would then add those files to a queue to be deleted down the road. However, there doesn't appear to be a way to implement such a solution in the languages I program in (JVM languages like Java and Scala).

So: I'm looking for the most efficient way to keep a directory ""as clean as it can be"" on Windows, preferably with a JVM language. Also, though I've never programmed with Powershell, I'd consider it if it offered this kind of functionality.  Finally, if there are 3rd party tools out there to do such things, I'd like to hear about them.

Thanks.

Telling a UITextField to become first responder while embedded in a UITableViewCell,"I have a UITextField that is a subview of a UITableViewCell.

When my view loads, I want the text field to become first responder. I have a pointer to the text field in the table cell, so to do this I am trying:

[myTextField becomeFirstResponder];


This returns NO all the time, regardless of when it's called, which according to the docs means the text field refused to become first responder... What am I doing wrong?

Edit:

The textfield properly responds to being touched. It bring up the keyboard then. It's only when telling it to becomefirstresponder programmatically that the problem happens.

Multithreading python application hangs while running its threads,"I am trying to create a MainObject which is availible as a DBus service. This MainObject should always stay responsive to other objects/processes and for this non-blocking even while processing its items. for that reason items are processed in a seperate thread one after another (queue-style). You can add items to the MainObject via DBus or CommandLine. I simplified the sample (no dbus, no commandline) to show my problem.

My problem is, that if i reenable 'tt.join()' the application works as expected, but it is blocking to other processes. No wonder, tt.join makes the application wait until the seperate Thread has finished its work. On the other hand, if 'tt.join()' stays disabled, the application does not block to external dbus events, but never comes to 'ThreadTest done!' (look at real output)

Problem with jquery ajax in Opera and Google Chrome,"I have a page where I need to add a drag and drop functionality to certain elements.

What are the best practices to use to pass a web application from development staging to production?,"Our Development environment has many layers and is complicated to replicate or even backup effectively.  Basically the File system (ie. /usr/appdir/webapp...) has other applications serving our web application, those application we update doing svn updates from their repository.  

The use of the web application itself (as a user) will affect both the file system and the database.  So backing up the system is a matter of having a copy of both the file system and database (mysqldump) at the same point in time.  One of the two by itself will not be a complete backup since the application is very dynamic itself.

When we deploy an webapp to staging for one of our customers to test and enter data, then we have an environment that now is difficult to sync back from our development environment, or even to take it to production.  Since we will make change request from the customer in development, but the customer itself will make changes in staging.  

At this moment we are using freezing periods, where we ask our customers to make changes to development environments or even directly to production (before going live completely).

I am wondering if their is a best practice on how to have a effective process to pass from dev --> staging --> production?  Or if you might have some pointers.

Internet Explorer lags w/ IQueryable datasource. Firefox and Chrome A-OK. Video proof supplied,"I'd like to say it's the query, but it isn't.  Even when we go through it step-by-step, the queries finish without a hitch.  Even the .DataBind() method doesn't APPEAR to cause the lag.

Here's how I know it has to do with my IQueryable as the binding source:

Old code:


Call a stored procedure using SqlCommand and use SqlAdapter to fill a new DataTable.
The DataTable would be sent into a method for each DropDownList. (There are 5 DDLs)
Each method would feed the rows of the DataTable (yes, each of them) into an IEnumerable.
Multiple LINQ queries would be run against the IEnumerable to filter out the options we wanted, including a .Distinct(IEqualityComparer) and .Sort(x => x[""RowName""]);  (Again, each of the methods would perform this).
A new DataTable would be created via IEnumerable.CopyToDataTable() (Yes, again, each method)
The DropDownList.DataSource would be set to the new DataTable, and would then .DataBind().


This horrible travesty of a code would finish very quickly in IE.  Perhaps a second or two of think time.

Here's the new code, in the flesh:

IQueryable&lt;Expose_LotRuns&gt; elr = DB.Expose_LotRuns;

if (iTechID &gt; 0)
    elr = elr.Where(x =&gt; x.Master_LotRuns.Flows.CD_Techs.ID == iTechID);

if (iFlowID &gt; 0)
    elr = elr.Where(x =&gt; x.Master_LotRuns.Flows.ID == iFlowID);

if (iToolID &gt; 0)
    elr = elr.Where(x =&gt; x.Master_LotRuns.Tools.ID == iToolID);

if (iOperationID &gt; 0)
    elr = elr.Where(x =&gt; x.Master_LotRuns.Operations.ID == iOperationID);

if (iReticleID &gt; 0)
    elr = elr.Where(x =&gt; x.Reticles.ID == iReticleID);

var techs = from x in elr
                        where (x.Master_LotRuns.Flows.CD_Techs != null)
                        group x by new
                        {

Now, if you'll watch the following video, you'll see that the code above works very well in both Firefox and Chrome, and yet it blows in MS IE.  Normally I'd be happy with it because I don't use IE, but IE is company policy.  It's also worth mentioning that the lag only happens for the FIRST DDL, but not any of the subsequent selections.  Also, the initial load (which loads all data, not limited at all, using the same methods) does not take this long to load either.

Some please, PLEASE tell me why IE behaves like this, and what I can do to fix it.  BTW, it works just as badly in IE7 and IE8
","Internet Explorer lags w/ IQueryable datasource. Firefox and Chrome A-OK. Video proof supplied I'd like to say it's the query, but it isn't.  Even when we go through it step-by-step, the queries finish without a hitch.  Even the .DataBind() method doesn't APPEAR to cause the lag.

Here's how I know it has to do with my IQueryable as the binding source:

Old code:


Call a stored procedure using SqlCommand and use SqlAdapter to fill a new DataTable.
The DataTable would be sent into a method for each DropDownList. (There are 5 DDLs)
Each method would feed the rows of the DataTable (yes, each of them) into an IEnumerable.
Multiple LINQ queries would be run against the IEnumerable to filter out the options we wanted, including a .Distinct(IEqualityComparer) and .Sort(x => x[""RowName""]);  (Again, each of the methods would perform this).
A new DataTable would be created via IEnumerable.CopyToDataTable() (Yes, again, each method)
The DropDownList.DataSource would be set to the new DataTable, and would then .DataBind().


This horrible travesty of a code would finish very quickly in IE.  Perhaps a second or two of think time.

Here's the new code, in the flesh:

IQueryable&lt;Expose_LotRuns&gt; elr = DB.Expose_LotRuns;

if (iTechID &gt; 0)
    elr = elr.Where(x =&gt; x.Master_LotRuns.Flows.CD_Techs.ID == iTechID);

if (iFlowID &gt; 0)
    elr = elr.Where(x =&gt; x.Master_LotRuns.Flows.ID == iFlowID);

if (iToolID &gt; 0)
    elr = elr.Where(x =&gt; x.Master_LotRuns.Tools.ID == iToolID);

if (iOperationID &gt; 0)
    elr = elr.Where(x =&gt; x.Master_LotRuns.Operations.ID == iOperationID);

if (iReticleID &gt; 0)
    elr = elr.Where(x =&gt; x.Reticles.ID == iReticleID);

Looks like it is an issue with Heap Space.  What do I need to adjust the heap space for?  The App Server itself or the Broker?  How do I do this?

Sending secure data over the network in iPhone,"I have a query regarding sending secure data over the network in iPhone.

What should be used to secure credit-card, bank acct# etc. information which is sent over wireless network.

Is there any difference in methods if we use a native-app or a web-app? 

Are there any direct APIs available for this?

Any tutorial will be really helpful.
Thanks in advance.

EDIT :

So where exactly the certificate/encryption is needed?
Is following procedure correct? 

1]Make connection to “https:” web-service using NSURLConnection

2]The server should implement SSL/TLS Server will respond with a digital certificate (*.p12    file)

3]Client side authorization will be done. (Whether the obtained certificate is trusted or
   not is checked. If trusted,then we can continue. Otherwise exit gracefully) 

4]Now Secure Channel is established. Send the data (Credit card info. etc) to server. Encryption can be done using public/private key pair



I am able to connect to a ""http://"" SOAP webservice. procedure: 

1) Create a SOAP Envelope (With required i/p parameters)
 2) Make NSURL Object with required web service addr
3) Initialize 'NSMutableURLRequest' with above url
 4) Set parameters for NSMutableURLRequest
5) Initiate 'NSURLConnection' with above request.

After this automatically NSURLConnection methods are called. 
Now I want to connect to 'Https://' web-service and send sensitive info to it.

So,what extra needs to be done? Do I need to add extra methods or above approach works? (I send parameters as plain text from in http)
